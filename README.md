> Generate a CHANGELOG from git metadata

It's recommended you use the high level [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) library, which handles the the entire tagging and CHANGELOG
generation process.

Alternatively, the [conventional-changelog-cli)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-cli) allows you to generate a CHANGELOG from the
command line.
