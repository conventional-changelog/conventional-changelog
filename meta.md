## Common Issues

### Disabling Two Factor Authentication

[According to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/disabling-two-factor-authentication-for-your-personal-account/):

> Warning: If you're a member, billing manager, or outside collaborator
to a public repository of an organization that requires two-factor
authentication and you disable 2FA, you'll be automatically removed from the
organization, and you'll lose your access to their repositories.
To regain access to the organization, re-enable two-factor authentication
and contact an organization owner.

In the event that you disable, and then re-enable, 2FA, please reach out
to a member of the organization to be re-invited.
