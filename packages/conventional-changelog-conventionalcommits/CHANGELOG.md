### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* nested object properties no longer supported when sorting
* drop support for Node 8 (#599)
* **git-semver-tags:** --tagPrefix flag was changed to --tag-prefix
* drop support for Node 6 (#558)
* gitSemverTags now takes options followed by callback.
* moved BREAKING CHANGES to top of template.
* if ! is in the commit header, it now indicates a BREAKING CHANGE, and the description is used as the body.
* a ! character at the end of type will now be omitted
* forcing a breaking semver change based on https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/pull/385
* Re-use parser options object between components of a preset. For some
presets this may change the behavior of `conventional-recommended-bump`
as the parser options object for the `conventional-recommended-bump` options
within a preset were different than the parser options object for the
`conventional-changelog` options within a preset.

If you are not using `conventional-recommended-bump`, then this is
**not** a breaking change for you.
* **package:** Set the package's minimum required Node version to be the oldest LTS
currently supported by the Node Release working group. At this time,
that is Node 6 (which is in its Maintenance LTS phase).
* Anchor tags are removed from the changelog header templates. The
rendered Markdown will no longer contain anchor tags proceeding the
version number header that constitutes the changelog header. This means
that consumers of rendered markdown will not be able to use a URL that
has been constructed to contain a version number anchor tag reference,
since the anchor tag won't exist in the rendered markdown.

It's stronly recomended consumers use the full URL path to the release
page for a given version, as that URL is a permalink to that verison,
contains all relavent release information, and does not, otherwise, rely
on the anchor tag being excessible from the current page view.

As an example, for version `2.0.0` of a GitHub project, the following
URL should be used:
- https://github.com/conventional-changelog/releaser-tools/releases/tag/v2.0.0
*   The Angular conventions specifically say that breaking changes must
  start with "BREAKING CHANGE", not the plural form. Therefore the
  previous plural form "CHANGES" has been corrected to singular "CHANGE".

  Former "chore" type has been replaced by a type "build" for commits on
  the build system and "ci" for commits regarding CI
* **writer:** Logic for generating release headings has been changed to make all
heading levels the same (`##`/`h2`) for better compatibility with
screen readers and parsers, and to conform to HTML semantics. Patch
release titles are now wrapped in a `<small>` tag to maintain the
visual hierarchy of the previous style.

Fixes https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/214
* **eslint:** Trailing whitespaces at the beginning of commit messages
will not be saved anymore
* **deps:** Using conventional-changelog v1.
* **deps:** Use conventional-changelog^0.5.0
* Callback is removed. I think only stream interface should exists.
From does not have any default value.
* This module is imported from https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog, and is originally written by @vojtajina, @btford and @ajoslin.
* **help:** `overwrite` is now called `same-file`.

Fixes https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/issues/100
* **flags:** `--git-raw-commits-opts`, `--parser-opts` and `--writer-opts` are removed as they are considered uncommon, use `--config` is easier as people can write all options within one file and they can learn from existing presets.

Fixes https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/issues/100
* **context:** `context.host` cannot change the default of `context.linkReferences` because if the host is unknown, `context.host` is `undefined` and all links will just use `context.repository`.
* **notes:** `notes` in `noteGroups` is not an array of simple string any more but object. You must use `note.text` to access the equivalent of previous `note`.
* **notes:** `includeDetails` will only include `log` and `keyCommit`.
* **templates:** If `partials` is not empty, it should not ignore header, commit and footer partials.
* **reverse:** when there is no commits left for the last block of logs it will still try to generate one. (Assume commits might be rebased or lost but still need a new version).
* **noteGroups:** `options.noteGroups` is no longer available. Filter the notes from upstream or in `options.transform` instead.
* **version:** `version` is not a required field and it is moved to the `context` object. If version is found in the last commit, it will be overwritten.
* **cli:** Previously version number has to be passed as a flag. As a version number is compulsory, it does not make sense for a flag to be compulsory. So if a version number is passed as an input it is still valid.
* **transform:** `options.hashLength`, `options.maxSubjectLength` and `options.map` are deprecated in favour of `options.transform`.
* **map:** `options.replacements` is now `options.map` and it can also take functions
* **compareFunc:** commitGroupsCompareFn -> commitGroupsSort, commitsCompareFn -> commitsSort, noteGroupsCompareFn -> noteGroupsSort and notesCompareFn -> notesSort
* **compareFunc:** Default compare functions no longer sort by lexicographical order. They use `localeCompare` instead
* **merge:** `pull request` should be `merge`. Also make the parsed result to be consistent with other parts.
* **issuePrefixes:** `options.referenceKeywords` is now `options.referenceActions`
* **hash:** hash is no longer supported. This parser should just parse raw commit messages. Also text fields are appended with a newline "\n".
* **regex:** It returns a nomatch regex if it's keywords are missing.
* **headerParts:** `headerParts` does not limit to `type`, `scope` and `subject`. They can now be defined in `options.headerCorrespondence` and the order is the order of capturing group in `options.headerPattern`. If part is missing in `options.headerCorrespondence` it is `undefined`. If part is not captured but is not missing in `options.headerCorrespondence` it is `null`.
* **maxSubjectLength:** `maxSubjectLength` is not available any more.
* **correspondence:** body and footer will be null if they are not found. type and subject are nullable too.
* **references:** `closes` now becomes `references` and it is loosely based the links above.
* **parser:** The regex for matching notes are loosen. The semicolon and space are optional. The `notes` object is no longer a key-value object but an array of note object, such as
```js
{
  title: 'BREAKING AMEND',
  text: 'some breaking change'
}
```
The detection of notes, closes, continueNote and isBody are mutually exclusive.
* **breaks:** Variable name related to `breaks` changes to `notes`, because "Important Notes" a more generic term. There is no functional changes.
* **stream:** It no longer skips the chunk if commit cannot be parsed. An empty string is passed to down stream
* This module is imported from https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog, and is originally written by @vojtajina, @btford and @ajoslin.
* **unreleased:** If `context.version` is the same as the version of the last release, by default the unreleased chagnelog will not output.
* **config:** `options.preset` is removed in favour of `options.config`
