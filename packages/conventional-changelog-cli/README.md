> Generate a changelog from git metadata

*[Changelog?](https://speakerdeck.com/stevemao/compose-a-changelog)*

**Note** You don't have to use the angular commit convention. For the best result of the tool to tokenize you commit and produce flexible output, it's recommended to use a commit convention.


## Quick start

```sh
$ npm install -g conventional-changelog-cli
$ cd my-project
$ conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s
```

This will *not* overwrite any previous changelogs. The above generates a changelog based on commits since the last semver tag that matches the pattern of "Feature", "Fix", "Performance Improvement" or "Breaking Changes".

If this is your first time using this tool and you want to generate all previous changelogs, you could do

```sh
$ conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0
```

This *will* overwrite any previous changelogs if they exist.

All available command line parameters can be listed using CLI: `conventional-changelog --help`.

**Hint:** You can alias your command or add it to your package.json. EG: `"changelog": "conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0"`.

To fully customize the tool, please checkout [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog) and [conventional-changelog-core](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-core) docs. You can find more details there. **Note: `config` here can work with `preset`, which is different than `options.config` in conventional-changelog.**


## Example output

- https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/blob/master/packages/conventional-changelog/CHANGELOG.md
- https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
- https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md


## Recommended workflow

1. Make changes
1. Commit those changes
1. Make sure Travis turns green
1. Bump version in `package.json`
1. `conventionalChangelog`
1. Commit `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` files
1. Tag
1. Push

The reason why you should commit and tag after `conventionalChangelog` is that the CHANGELOG should be included in the new release, hence `gitRawCommitsOpts.from` defaults to the latest semver tag.


### With `npm version`

Using the npm scripts to our advantage with the following hooks:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "version": "conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s && git add CHANGELOG.md"
  }
}
```

You could follow the following workflow

1. Make changes
1. Commit those changes
1. Pull all the tags
1. Run the [`npm version [patch|minor|major]`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) command
1. Push

You could optionally add a `preversion` script to package your project or running a full suit of test.
And a `postversion` script to clean your system and push your release and tags.

By adding a `.npmrc` you could also automate your commit message and set your tag prefix as such:

```
tag-version-prefix=""
message="chore(release): %s :tada:"
```


## Why

- Used by AngularJS, JSHint and related projects.
- Easy fully automate changelog generation. You could still add more points on top of it.
- Ignoring reverted commits, templating with [handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) and links to references, etc. Open an [issue](../../issues/new) if you want more reasonable features.
- Intelligently setup defaults but yet fully configurable with presets of [popular projects](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog#preset).
- Everything internally or externally is pluggable.
- A lot of tests and actively maintained.

### Problems with [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator) or similar projects

- Opinionated on how to write commits, issues or PRs.
- No or partially support reference links.
- Not system agnostic. Only support GitHub.
- No template support. The output is mostly certain format of markdown.
- No presets of popular commit message conventions.
- Not modularized. Over the years [modularization is proven to be the best practice](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/10#issuecomment-117766328).
- No tests or coverage is too low. Program might be buggy.
- Do not read your project's environment.
- No or few task runner or build tool integrations.
